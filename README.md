**XM SendSecure** is a collaborative file exchange platform that is both highly secure and simple to use.
It is expressly designed to allow for the secure exchange of sensitive documents via virtual SafeBoxes.

XM SendSecure comes with a **Web API**, which is **RESTful**, uses **HTTPs** and returns **JSON**.

Specific libraries have been published for various languages:
[C#](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-csharp),
[Java](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-java),
[JavaScript](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-js),
**PHP**,
[Python](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-python)
and
[Ruby](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-ruby).

# sendsecure-php

**This library allows you to use the XM SendSecure Web API via PHP.**

With this library, you will be able to:
* Authenticate SendSecure users
* Create new SafeBoxes

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- PHP version 5.6 or 7.0
- PHPcurl (compatible with php version)
- The XM SendSecure solution, provided by [XMedius](https://www.xmedius.com?source=sendsecure-php) (demo accounts available on demand)

## Install Package

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-js.git
```



# Quick Start

## Authentication (Retrieving API Token)

Authentication is done using an API Token, which must be first obtained based on SendSecure enterprise account and user credentials.
Here is the minimum code to get such a user-based API Token.

```php
<?php
  include 'sdk/sendsecure/client.php';

  $user_email = 'darthvader@empire.com';
  $endpoint = 'https://portal.xmedius.com'
  $username = 'darthvader';
  $password = 'd@Rk$1De';
  $enterprise = 'deathstar';
  $device_id = 'DV-TIE/x1';
  $device_name = 'TIE Advanced x1'

  $user_token = Client::get_user_token($enterprise, $username, $password, $device_id, $device_name, $endpoint);
  echo "\n" . $user_token->{'token'} . "\n";
  echo "\n" . $user_token->{'user_id'} . "\n";
  ?>
```


## SafeBox Creation (Using SafeBox Helper Class)

Here is the minimum required code to create a SafeBox â€“ with 1 recipient, a subject, a message and 1 attachment.
This example uses the user's *default* security profile (which requires to be set in the account).

```php
<?php
  include 'src/sdk/sendsecure/client.php';

  // Define parameters of the SendSecure user (sender/SafeBox Owner)
  $user_email = 'darthvader@empire.com';
  $enterprise_account = 'deathstar';
  $endpoint = 'https://portal.xmedius.com';

  // Create a Client object
  $client = new Client($user_token->{'token'}, $user_token->{'user_id'}, $enterprise_account);

  // Get the default SecurityProfile object
  $security_profile = $client->default_security_profile($user_email);

  // Create a Recipient object and a ContactMethod object
  $recipient = new Recipient('lukeskywalker@rebels.com');
  $contact_method = new ContactMethod('555-232-5334');
  $recipient->contact_methods = [$contact_method];

  // Create an Attachment object
  $attachment = Attachment::from_file_path('Birth_Certificate.pdf', 'application/pdf"');

  // Create a Safebox object
  $safebox = new Safebox($user_email);
  $safebox->subject = 'Family matters';
  $safebox->message = 'Son, you will find attached the evidence.';
  $safebox->recipients = [$recipient];
  $safebox->attachments = [$attachment];
  $safebox->security_profile = $security_profile;
  $safebox->notification_language = 'en';

  // Submit the Safebox object
  $safebox_response = $client->submit_safebox($safebox);
  var_dump($safebox_response);
?>
```
